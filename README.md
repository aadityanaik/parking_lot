UPDATE:

Mostly funtioning Parking Lot System. A few glitches are there which i have opened issues for. When downloading the sources to a computer, make sure that all sources are in the same directory. Also, create 2 empty folders named "2wheeler" and "4wheeler" in the same directory.

UPDATE:

Converted the program source file from a single source file into multiple source files. 
The one with the entry point (main function) is called pklot.cpp.
This makes it more convenient to make changes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: 
Converted the system into one that uses file management, thus negating any unnecessary use of 2002 objects, bringing the
number of instantiated objects down to 4.
